# Measles Tracker

## General data considerations
All data are subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates in order to accurately reflect trends, changes in national case definitions, and/or reporting practices. Caution should be used when comparing published data longitudinally.

Case definitions, testing strategies, reporting practices, and lag times (e.g. time to case notification and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries. These factors, among others, influence the data presented and may lead to misinterpretation.
